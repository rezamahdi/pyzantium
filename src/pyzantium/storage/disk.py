    Disk storage for storing blocks of a blockchain on disk

    This class is the default implementation of storage system for blockchain.
    Blocks are stored by their hash similar to git's object storage:

        #. In root directory of storage, there will be a directory named `blocks`.

        #. In `blocks` directory will be some directories with 2 letters name.
           name is infered from two beggining letters of block's hash.

        #. A file named `index` is stored in root directory of storage that is
           a simple text file with hashes of blocks sorted by time in it (most
           recent last) to accelerate access to blocks

    :param creeate: Whether to create a new storage or open an existing one.

       If this param is set to ``True`` and a storage allready exist in
       ``path``, then an exception will raise.
